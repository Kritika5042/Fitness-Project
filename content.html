                <h3>Nutrition & Hydration</h3>

        
                        <p>70% of your fitness journey is about what you eat. It's okay if you can't make it to the gym 4 times a week, but watching your diet is crucial.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>High-Protein Diet:</strong> Prioritize protein-rich foods like Chicken, Eggs, Greek yogurt, Cottage Cheese, Tofu, and Lentils. Protein keeps you satiated for a longer time, helping you maintain a lower calorie intake while keeping you fuller longer. Pair this with high fiber foods</li>
                            <li><strong>Carbs Matter:</strong> Fuel your body with nutritious carbs like rice, chickpea pasta, or sourdough bread instead of processed wheat-based options.</li>
                            <li><strong>Craving Sweets?</strong> Opt for natural sugar sources like dates, watermelon, or any fruit of your choice. You can never overeat fruits!</li>
                        
                                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drinking at least 3 liters of water daily to stay energized and support metabolism.</p>
